What you’re about to see (Sobina) is called YAML front-matter
- and yes, YAML stands for “YAML Ain’t Markup Language” (because the original
acronym was “Yet Another Markup Language” and they got meta with it! ￿).
Think of it as the control panel for your Quarto document - it’s where you tell Quarto
how to dress up your content. Want HTML? PDF? Should code run or just show? It’s
all configured here in this little language-within-a-language that makes your markdown
document go from “meh” to “WOW!” ￿
